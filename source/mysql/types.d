/// Structures for MySQL types not built-in to D/Phobos.

/++
A simple struct to represent time difference.

D's std.datetime does not have a type that is closely compatible with the MySQL
interpretation of a time difference, so we define a struct here to hold such
values.

struct TimeDiff
{
	bool negative;
	int days;
	ubyte hours, minutes, seconds;
}

/++
A D struct to stand for a TIMESTAMP

It is assumed that insertion of TIMESTAMP values will not be common, since in general,
such columns are used for recording the time of a row insertion, and are filled in
automatically by the server. If you want to force a timestamp value in a prepared insert,
set it into a timestamp struct as an unsigned long in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
and use that for the approriate parameter. When TIMESTAMPs are retrieved as part of
a result set it will be as DateTime structs.

struct Timestamp
{
	ulong rep;
}
