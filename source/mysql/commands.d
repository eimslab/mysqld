Use a DB via plain SQL statements.

Commands that are expected to return a result set - queries - have distinctive
methods that are enforced. That is it will be an error to call such a method
with an SQL command that does not produce a result set. So for commands like
SELECT, use the `query` functions. For other commands, like
INSERT/UPDATE/CREATE/etc, use `exec`.

A struct to represent specializations of prepared statement parameters.

If you are executing a query that will include result columns that are large objects
it may be expedient to deal with the data as it is received rather than first buffering
it to some sort of byte array. These two variables allow for this. If both are provided
then the corresponding column will be fed to the stipulated delegate in chunks of
chunkSize, with the possible exception of the last chunk, which may be smaller.
The 'finished' argument will be set to true when the last chunk is set.

Be aware when specifying types for column specializations that for some reason the
field descriptions returned for a resultset have all of the types TINYTEXT, MEDIUMTEXT,
TEXT, LONGTEXT, TINYBLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, BLOB, and LONGBLOB lumped as type 0xfc
contrary to what it says in the protocol documentation.

Internal implementation for the exec and query functions.

Execute a one-off SQL command.

Use this method when you are not going to be using the same command repeatedly.
It can be used with commands that don't produce a result set, or those that
do. If there is a result set its existence will be indicated by the return value.

Any result set can be accessed via Connection.getNextRow(), but you should really be
using the query function for such queries.

Execute a one-off SQL SELECT command and returns a single value,
the first column of the first row received.

If the query did not produce any rows, or the rows it produced have zero columns,
this will return `Nullable!Variant()`, ie, null. Test for this with `result.isNull`.

If the query DID produce a result, but the value actually received is NULL,
then `result.isNull` will be FALSE, and `result.get` will produce a Variant
which CONTAINS null. Check for this with `result.get.type == typeid(typeof(null))`.

If the SQL command does not produce a result set (such as INSERT/CREATE/etc),
then `mysql.exceptions.MySQLNoResultRecievedException` will be thrown. Use
`exec` instead for such commands.

	Execute a prepared SQL command for the case where you expect a result set,

	Use this method when you will use the same command repeatedly.
	This method will throw if the SQL command does not produce a result set.
	
	If there are long data items among the expected result columns you can specify
	that they are to be subject to chunked transfer via a delegate.

	Execute a prepared SQL command for the case where you expect a result set,

	Execute a prepared SQL command to place result values into a set of D variables.
	
	Use this method when you will use the same command repeatedly.
	It will throw if the specified command does not produce a result set, or

	Get the next Row of a pending result set.
	
	This method can be used after either execSQL() or execPrepared() have returned true
	to retrieve result set rows sequentially.
	
	Similar functionality is available via execSQLSequence() and execPreparedSequence() in
	which case the interface is presented as a forward range of Rows.
	
	This method allows you to deal with very large result sets either a row at a time,
	or by feeding the rows into some suitable container such as a linked list.

	Execute a stored function, with any required input variables, and store the
	return value into a D variable.
	
	For this method, no query string is to be provided. The required one is of
	the form "select foo(?, ? ...)". The method generates it and the appropriate
	bindings - in, and out. Chunked transfers are not supported in either
	direction. If you need them, create the parameters separately, then use
	execPreparedResult() to get a one-row, one-column result set.
	
	If it is not possible to convert the column value to the type of target,
	then execFunction will throw. If the result is NULL, that is indicated
	by a false return value, and target is unchanged.
	
	In the interest of performance, this method assumes that the user has the
	equired information about the number and types of IN parameters and the
	type of the output variable. In the same interest, if the method is called
	repeatedly for the same stored function, prepare() is omitted after the first call.
	
	WARNING: This function is not currently unittested.

	Params:
	   T = The type of the variable to receive the return result.
	   U = type tuple of arguments
	   name = The name of the stored function.
	   target = the D variable to receive the stored function return result.

	Execute a stored procedure, with any required input variables.
	
	For this method, no query string is to be provided. The required one is
	of the form "call proc(?, ? ...)". The method generates it and the
	appropriate in bindings. Chunked transfers are not supported. If you
	need them, create the parameters separately, then use execPrepared() or

	In the interest of performance, this method assumes that the user has
	the required information about the number and types of IN parameters.
	In the same interest, if the method is called repeatedly for the same
	stored function, prepare() and other redundant operations are omitted
	after the first call.
	
	OUT parameters are not currently supported. It should generally be
	possible with MySQL to present them as a result set.

		name = The name of the stored procedure.
